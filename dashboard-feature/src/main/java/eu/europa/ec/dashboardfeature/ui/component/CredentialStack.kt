/**
 * How far each card behind the front one peeks out above it, i.e. how much of a covered card's
 * header block (logo + title + category, see [CredentialCard]) stays visible. Measured against
 * [CredentialCard]'s 20dp padding plus its title/category text block, with a small margin.
 *
 * Also the "slot height" used while dragging a card: crossing half of this distance past a
 * neighboring card swaps the two, exactly like reordering a list one slot at a time.

/**
 * The "collapsed" (recogida) credential layout: full-size [CredentialCard]s stacked on top of one
 * another like a single deck, each offset down by [STACK_PEEK_HEIGHT] so only the header strip of
 * every card behind the front one stays visible. The frontmost (last) card keeps its full original
 * size and shows all of its content, matching the reference wallet screenshot.
 *
 * Takes the FULL, flattened credential list (every category combined) so every credential —
 * regardless of category — is part of the same deck with the exact same peek spacing, and any
 * newly added credential simply becomes the new frontmost card instead of starting a separate,
 * visually detached stack.
 *
 * Every card — whether fully visible or only peeking — keeps the exact same [onItemClick]
 * navigation as the extended view: Compose only routes a tap to the topmost composable actually
 * drawn at that point, so a tap on a peeking card's visible strip naturally reaches that card's
 * own `clickable`, with no custom hit-testing needed.
 *
 * Any card can be dragged up or down to ANY position in the deck, not just the front: as it's
 * dragged past the midpoint of a neighboring card, the two swap places right away (calling
 * [onReorder] with the list in its new order) and the card keeps moving under the finger from
 * there, exactly like reordering a list one slot at a time. Releasing leaves it wherever it
 * currently is; every other (non-dragged) card animates smoothly into its new resting slot as it
 * gets displaced.
 *
 * Each card is wrapped in [key] by its document id: without it, Compose would match each loop
 * iteration's remembered state (the drag-settle animation in particular) to its POSITION rather
 * than to the actual credential there, so after a swap the wrong card would inherit the wrong
 * animation state — visually "stuck" on top instead of settling behind its new neighbor. Keying
 * by id keeps every card's own state (and stacking order) correctly attached to it as it moves.
